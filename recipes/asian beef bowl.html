        <div class="description">
        <p>This is not a traditional Chinese or other Asian recipe, hence the obscure name “Asian Beef Bowls”.</p>
        <p>Unlike most stir fries, this one doesnt come with a ton of sauce. But its juicy and the beef has a ton of flavour in it so when its all mixed up with the rice, you certainly wont feel like youre missing sauce. Promise!</p>

            <p class="header">Ingredients</p>
            <ul>
                <p class="type">Sauce:</p>
                <li>1 tbsp Hoisin Sauce (or sub with Oyster)</li>
                <li>2 tbsp Oyster Sauce (or sub with 1 1/2 tbsp Hoisin)</li>
                <li>1 tbsp Chinese cooking wine (or Mirin, dry sherry, sake or any rice wine) (Note 1)</li>
                <li>2 1/2 tbsp dark soy sauce (Note 2)</li>
                <li>2 tsp white sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp sesame oil</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp white pepper (or sub with black)</li>

                <p class="type">Stir Fry:</p>
                <li>1 tbsp oil</li>
                <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
                <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
                <li>500 g /1 lb beef mince (ground beef) (lean is good)</li>
                <li>1/2 cup shallots / scallions , sliced, plus more for garnish</li>

                <p class="type">Garnishes:</p>
                <li>Sesame seeds</li>

                <p class="heder">Instructions</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Mix Sauce together in a bowl</li>
                    <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add garlic and onion, cook for 1 minute or until onion starts browning.</li>
                    <li>Add beef and cook, breaking it up as you go.</li>
                    <li>Once the beef has all changed from red to brown, add Sauce. Cook for a further 2 minutes, or until Sauce has evaporated and beef is cooked. If you want the beef cooked more, add a splash of water and keep cooking (I don't do this).</li>
                    <li>Stir through shallots, then serve over rice, garnished with more shallots and sesame seeds, if desired. Or for a low carb, low cal option, try Cauliflower Rice!</li>
                </ol>

            <p class="header">Recipe Notes:</p>
            <ol>
                <li class="notes">Chinese cooking wine</li>- sub with Mirin, dry sherry or cooking sake. If you can't consume alcohol, add 1/4 cup of chicken stock/broth - the sauce will take around 3 minutes to evaporate, but the end result will be similar!
                <li class="notes">Soy Sauce</li>- This recipe calls for DARK soy sauce, has more flavour than light and all purpose soy sauce, and makes the food a deeper brown colour. Can sub with all purpose soy or sauce, but beef colour won't be as dark brown.
                <li class="notes">Storage</li>- leftovers will keep in the fridge for 4 days, or freeze for up to 3 months!
                <li class="notes">Nutrition</li>- per serving, excluding rice.
